# Ensemble-Methods
Classification experiments with ensemble methods bagging and Adaboost using SVMS, full decision trees, and base decision trees that have one node and 2 children.
A simple holdout validation method is used with 75% traning and 35% test data. The type of model used, number of models, and number of repitions can all be manipulated.

Top Avg SVM Test accuracies: 
* Bagging:  88.3%   (10 models)
* Boosting: 87.7%   (4 models)

Top Avg simple DT Test accuracies:
* Bagging:  88.0%   (15 models)
* Boosting: 87.1%   (10 models)

Top Avg full DT Test accuracy:
* Bagging:  88.9%   (14 models)
* Boosting: 86.3%   (8 models)
